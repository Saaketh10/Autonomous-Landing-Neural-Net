AI-Powered Precision: Revolutionizing Lunar Landings with Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
This project addresses the critical challenge of ensuring safe and precise lunar landings, an essential aspect of future space exploration missions. Leveraging the power of deep learning and reinforcement learning, the project aims to develop an autonomous system capable of guiding a lunar lander to its target with high accuracy.

Problem Statement:
Traditional methods for lunar landing rely heavily on pre-programmed instructions and human oversight, which can be prone to errors and limitations. The dynamic and unpredictable nature of lunar terrain requires a more adaptable and intelligent solution. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by developing an AI-driven system that can autonomously navigate and land on the moon.

Motivations: 
The increasing interest in lunar exploration and the need for reliable landing systems drive this project. Accurate lunar landings are crucial for the success of future missions, including resource extraction, scientific research, and potential human settlement. By incorporating AI techniques, this project aims to enhance the precision and safety of lunar landings, contributing to the broader goals of space exploration.

Approach:
The project utilizes two primary AI techniques:

Reinforcement Learning (RL): An RL model is trained to make sequential decisions, optimizing the lunar lander's trajectory to ensure a safe and precise landing. The model learns from simulated environments, continually improving its performance through trial and error.

Deep Neural Networks (DNN): A neural network model processes lunar elevation maps to assist the RL agent in making informed decisions. The DNN enhances the system's ability to interpret complex patterns and react to unexpected situations during the landing process.
